This is the semi-complete project of a Multiplayer First Person Shooter (v1.0) made entirely in Unity 4 using PhotonNetwork. 

Due to github regulations about file size I can't upload it here so I uploaded the first version to dropbox and you can find it and download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l5sa47xrs7usu9m/Multiplayer-FPS-unity-project-.zip?dl=0

## What is it?

It's an old project of mine that I constantly work on when I have some spare time. It is actually a functioning multiplayer online game where you can team up with you friends (up to 8 players). The map on this one is a clone of the original Unreal Tournament called Facing Worlds. I made it entirely on Blender 3D after following the tutorials of [quill18creates](https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18creates) (a great Youtuber who does excellent Unity tutorials). Actually most of the basic stuff (like movement, basic animation, shooting and networking) are from quill18's tutorials. 

## Added features 
After following the tutorials, I took the liberty and added many extra features that made the game more fun and playable like: 

* A health sign, that's showing the players health at any moment
* Ping calculator, so that the player can see the delay to the server
* Player Names. Players can see the names of their opponents in red (when they are on sight)  and the name of their allies in green hovering above their heads 
* A fully functioning scoreboard that can show the kills and deaths of every player online at any time
* Teleporters at the mid-level room that can transfer players from one building to another 
* Lighting Torches inside the rooms (just for fun :P) 
* Fixed some movement bugs (After a lot of testing with friends)
* Probably a Facebook Integration (if I can do that in a cool way) though I don't think Facebook is a place for FPSs 

## Plans for future releases 
As I said, the project is not really complete in any way. I am planning on adding lots and lots of extra features when I get the time, like: 

* Upgrading the UI from NGUI to the new Unity 4.6 UI and generally upgrading the project to Unity 5
* Fixing the terrible animations :P 
* New weapons and creating a weapon swapping mechanism (and animation)
* Power Ups, around the map and after multiple killstreaks
* New maps 

If you have any idea about a new feature please don't hesitate to contact me. Also, don't forget to let me know about any bugs you may find.

## Some more screens of the game:
